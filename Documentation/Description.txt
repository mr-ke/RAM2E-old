RAM2E II (GW4203B) expands the Apple IIe's memory by 8 MB, 
as well as enabling double-high-resolution graphics 
and 80-column text display modes.


Low-Power, SDRAM-Based Design
----------------------------------------
Thanks to a modern, low-power design, 
RAM2E II uses a maximum of 0.2 watts when idle
(40 mA @ 5V) and 0.3W in active use (60 mA @ 5V). 
Unlike other IIe auxilliary memory cards, which are 
built with vintage asynchronous DRAM chips, 
RAM2E II uses modern SDRAM. This design allows for 
low power consumption and improved reliability 
over other memory cards using 15+ year old chips. 


Small Size, Low-Profile
----------------------------------------
RAM2E II features a small board outline and is the 
thinnest Apple IIe auxilliary memory card ever produced, 
at under 4mm thin. Small and thin dimensions improve 
the mechanical compatibility between RAM2E II and 
peripheral cards installed into the IIe's Slot 1.


Adjustable Capacity, Highly Compatible
----------------------------------------
RAM2E II is highly compatible with existing software. 
An adjustable capacity feature allows the memory size 
to be set to 64 kB, 512 kB, 1 MB, 4 MB, or 8 MB, 
improving compatibility with software which expecting 
a particular memory capacity. 
Capacity settings can be set temporarily 
or saved in nonvolatile memory. 
The capacity adjustment utility is available on 
_RAM2E II's support page_.


Ecologically Friendly, Gold-Plated PCB
----------------------------------------
RAM2E II features a lead-free, ENIG gold-plated,
4-layer PCB and is fully EU RoHS-compliant. 
All units are tested extensively before shipment. 
Only new parts are used to build RAM2E II, 
and all RAM2E II cards are manufactured in our 
semi-automated facility in Columbus, Ohio, 
in the United States. 


Open-Source Design
----------------------------------------
RAM2E II's design is fully open-source. 
The schematics, board layouts, CPLD firmware, 
and utility software are all freely available 
for commercial and noncommercial use.
